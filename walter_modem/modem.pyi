class Modem():
    """
    Singleton factory for constructing a modem instance with the given mixins.

    This class enforces the singleton pattern, ensuring that only one modem instance
    can exist at any time. Attempts to create additional instances will always return
    the original instance.

    The library comes with a variety of mixins (e.g. SocketMixin, HTTPMixin, CoapMixin, ...)
    that can be inlcuded when constructing the modem-instance. By only loading the mixins you need,
    the library's memory footprint is kept small.

    For detailed information information on creating custom mixins,
    refer to the developer documentation on the GitHub wiki.

    PDP context, SIM & network and power saving mixins are included by default but can be turned of
    individually, see params.
